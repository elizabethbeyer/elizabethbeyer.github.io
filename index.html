      <p>Approximately 200 demonstrators gathered in response to the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico following hurricane Maria and voiced their frustration with the current administration’s response.</p>
      <p>“People in Puerto Rico are literally dying,” said Rossana Rodriguez, a member of the Chicago Boricua Resistance, the human rights group that organized the event. Rodriguez’s hometown is Humacao, Puerto Rico and her family, with the exception of her husband and child, currently live on the island.</p>
      <p>“We are here to yell,” she continued, her voice breaking, “To share the desperation, to share the stories we have heard about our families, to share the rage and to demand that action is taken.” Attendees gave impassioned speeches about family members, who they have been unable to reach following the hurricane, between acoustic songs sung in spanish.</p>
      <p>After the rally’s scheduled end time, demonstrators attempted to march north on Wabash Avenue but were stopped by police. Event organizers redirected the group to the Chicago Riverwalk where they marched passed restaurant patrons and chanted expletives directed at President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration has been criticized for the slow federal response to the devastation in Puerto Rico. “There has been a much quicker response to the events that happened in Texas and Florida following [hurricanes] Harvey and Irma,” said Karen Goldner, a rally attendee and Chicago native.</p>
      <p>According to Rodriguez, aid has been collected but not released and people on the island don’t understand what is causing the delay. “They’re American people too,” said William Camargo, a California native, “I see this as a social injustice.”</p>
